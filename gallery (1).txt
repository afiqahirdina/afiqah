    The Toyota 86 and the Subaru BRZ are 2+2 sports cars jointly developed by Toyota and Subaru, 
    manufactured at Subaru's Gunma assembly plant.
    The 2+2 fastback coupÃ© has a naturally aspirated boxer engine, front-engined, rear-wheel-drive configuration, 53/47 front/rear weight balance and low centre of gravity; 
    it was inspired by Toyota's earlier AE86, a small, light, front-engine/rear-drive Corolla variant widely popular 
    for Showroom Stock, Group A, Group N, Rally, Club and drift racing.
    For the first-generation model, Toyota marketed the sports car as the 86 
    in Asia, Australia, North America (from August 2016), South Africa, and South America
    The second-generation model is marketed by Toyota as the GR86 as part of the Gazoo Racing family.>
